// ## Mod0 Arrays Practice

// Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Strings.
// Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Numbers.
// Declare a variable that stores an Array of at least 4 Booleans.

var name = ["Tim", "Allye", "Martin", "Anthony"]
var age = [31.5, 28, 32, 31]
var boolean = [true, false, false, true]

// Array methods
name.pop();
console.log(name);
//Pop should remove the last element from the name Array, when excuted all names should be displayed besides
// "Anthony".
age.push();
console.log(age);
//Push will place any new element to the end of the Array when added.
boolean.shift();
console.log(boolean);
//Shift will remove the first element in the Array.
// Index positions: viewing name: "Tim" is in the 0 index position, "Allye" is 1. End is 3.
// Index positions: in both age and boolean are the same as name listed above 0,1,2,3.
// Index positions: always start with 0.
