## Self Evaluation

1. **How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?**
  * Arrays have felt a bit like a rollercoaster, at first they seemed very straight forward
  and easy to understand but as I learned more about Arrays and things like Array Methods and how to
  write the code involving Arrays I felt like I fell behind. So far I believe I do have a good understanding of the basics of Arrays and what they do and what they are used for. I would say I am at least at a 3.5 maybe a 4 at this moment.
1. **Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?**
  * I believe that my current knowledge about Arrays should not hold me back, I will be looking into more Array methods to better understand what options I have when applying them. Like most of my experience so far I just need to continue my practice and I am confident I will be able to continue my pace of learning.
1. **What questions do you have about Arrays?**
  * I would like to research and find more on the limitations of Arrays and try to understand how much power they really have in the coding world. Besides that methods and what they are used for is my biggest question but I am sure as I continue to learn I will have that answered.
